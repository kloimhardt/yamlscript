;; YAMLScript is a programming language that is hosted by Clojure platforms.
;; It can be used to add scripting to abilities to YAML files.

;; The yamlscript.compiler is responsible for converting YAMLScript code to
;; Clojure code. It does this by sending the input through a stack of 7
;; transformation libraries.
